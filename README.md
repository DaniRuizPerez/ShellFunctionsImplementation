Shell Functions Implementation
============

This was the project for the Operating Systems course in my sophomore year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain) developed with my teammate.


It is a collection of 20+ low-level C functions wrapped by a shell. The 3 pdfs contain the details of the requirements, all of them were successfully implemented by us.
